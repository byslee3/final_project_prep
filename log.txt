TUESDAY :: Nov 6

Reconstructing database schema by getting a JSON string from URL, then matching it against what shows up on the webpage. In order to understand what data there is in Polyvore.

Sketching out ideas for UX and what to do with this data. Idea of outfit recommendations using k-nearest neighbors algorithm (would have to pull a dataset that forces there to be lots of overlap between users). Or, using the fact that Polyvore sets are human-curated groupings of items --> create a "social graph" of outfit items.

What to do??
