PRODUCT
each product record has the following attributes (from the set page)

unique id
# of people who saved it
whether it's a product (as opposed to graphic)
brand id number
brand as text (e.g. "Miu Miu")
"category_order"  ???
"category_id"  is an integer
title = short text description with lots of data (could be used to tag)
"created by" and an id number (the original user who created?)
price (several different options)
domain name of the retailer who is carrying it ("host")
specific url where the item can be bought (useful for pointing people there later)
should save polyvore img url as well - so we can pull it later

......................................

USERS
fans (each page only shows the first 18, will need some way to find the rest)
(this is from the page for each set)

user_score (???)
user name
createdon (time stamp - probably when the user Liked?)
several id numbers, figure out which is the unique user id

.......................................

SET
attributes of each set (taken from the specific page for that set)
under the "collection" key of the dictionary

unique id
many product ids associated with that set
many fans ids associated with that set
integer count of the number of fans/faves
img URL - will need this to pull things
"anchor" = their way of classifying things??
the user id who created this, and their user name
timestamp for when it was created
"score" -??
number of pageviews?
a dictionary key called "confirmed_tags"??
